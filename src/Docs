Redux -> core lib
react-redux -> implementation

1. Create store:
- Using "configureStore"
- There should be only one store in a application.
- introduce reducers in it.

2. Feature ==> Slice
- Using "createSlice" method
- 3 things required: name, initialState(i.e bydefault value), reducer's list.
- The funtion of reducers can be written separately or within the key value of reducer.

Reducers: In reducer, we get access of two things, state and action.
eg.  addTodo: (state, action) => {
    const todo = {}
}
state.todos.push(todo)

state: In state we get update state value in the store.
action: It gives action.payload
